### Focus Areas:  I prioritized several key areas for the project:

Networking and Error Handling: Creating a robust and async network layer that uses protocols for dependency injection to facilitate testing. 
Data Decoding and State Management: Building reliable decoding logic and managing state effectively with @Published properties.
Caching: Using a simple NSCache for efficient image caching.
This approach ensures that the app remains responsive, modular, and easy to maintain.

### Time Spent: I spent approximately 4 hours on the project:

2 hours on setting up the project, creating network and image services.
1 hour building UI views and implementing state management.
1 hour on testing, debugging, and documentation.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
